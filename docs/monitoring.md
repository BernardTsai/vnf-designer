Monitoring
==========

This option is only available when utilising the VNF Designer as a web-service.

It allows to determine the status of a current deployment by clicking on the "Monitoring" icon in the header region:

<img src="images/overview.png" alt="Overview" width="50%"/>

It will display the architecture of the virtualised network function and update the status every 10 seconds:

* the status for entities in black is unknown,
* entities in red are down or are in a failure state,
* entities in green are active and show no errors.
